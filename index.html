      <h2>HongKong</h2>
      <p>HongKong is the place where I was born and lived for about 9 years. HongKong is made up of an island and another part of land that is connected to mainland China called Kowloon. I lived on the island in a place called Central. It is one of the busiest places in HK, It is a beautiful city, places like Victoria Harbour and Causeway Bay are definitely worth a visit.<p>

      <h2>Toronto</h2>
      <p>Toronto is the capital of the province of Ontario. It is the most populous city in Canada, and the fourth populous city in North America. It is also recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world. I came to Canada in 2019 and studied in Lakefield College School. Whenever in holidays, I would go back to Toronto and live in my uncle's house. Last year during the Covid pandemic, the school closed and I wasn't able to go back to Shanghai. My uncle was happy to let me stay over the summer and it was a pleasant experience. </p>
