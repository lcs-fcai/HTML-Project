      <h2>HongKong</h2>
      <p>HongKong is the place where I was born. It is a beautiful city, places like Victoria Harbour and Causeway Bay are definitely worth a visit. It is also the place I lived for about 9 years.<p>

      <h2>Naples</h2>
      <p>Naples is an Italian city that lies on the Southern Coast of the Mediterranean Sea. It is the third largest city in Italy, just after Rome and Milan. I moved there with my mom in 2014 because of her working necessity for a year. It is a beautiful city with cozy weather and full of people with hospitality.</p>

      <p>Nagoya is a big city in Japan that locates on the Pacific Coast on central Hunshu(Japanese Island).It is one of Japan's largest port along with those of Tokyo, Osaka, Yokohama, Kobe, and Chiba.
