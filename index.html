      <h2>HongKong</h2>
      <p>HongKong is the place where I was born and lived for about 9 years. HongKong is made up of an island and another part of land that is connected to mainland China called Kowloon. It is a beautiful city, places like Victoria Harbour and Causeway Bay are definitely worth a visit.<p>

      <h2>Naples</h2>
      <p>Naples is an Italian city that lies on the Southern Coast of the <em>Mediterranean Sea</em>. It is the third largest city in Italy, just after Rome and Milan. I moved there with my mom in 2014 because of her working necessity for a year. It is a beautiful city with cozy weather and full of people with hospitality.</p>
