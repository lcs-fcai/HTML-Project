      <h2>HongKong</h2>
      <p>HongKong is the place where I was born and lived for about 9 years. HongKong is made up of an island and another part of land that is connected to mainland China called <em>Kowloon</em>. I lived on the island in a place called <em>Central</em>. It is one of the busiest places in HK, It is a beautiful city, places like <strong>Victoria Harbour</strong> and <strong>Causeway Bay</strong> are definitely worth a visit.</p>

      <h2>Naples</h2>
      <p>Naples is an Italian city that lies on the Southern Coast of the <strong>Mediterranean Sea</strong>. It is the third largest city in Italy, just after <em>Rome</em> and <em>Milan</em>. I moved there with my mom in 2014 because of her working necessity for a year. It is a beautiful city with cozy weather and full of people with hospitality. I loved the football club there called Napoli, who was playing well in Serie A(Italian Football league). It was quite the reason why I chose to play soccer later on. </p>

      <h2>Shanghai</h2>
      <p>Shanghai is a large metropolitan city located on the Southern estuary of the <em>Yangtze</em> River, with <em>Huangpu</em> river flowing through it into the East Sea. Although it is just slightly bigger than New York City, but has a population 3 times larger than NYC, approximately of 25 million(2018). I moved there with my family in fall, 2016, and lived there till summer,2019. The city has developed at a high speed since the 1980s, along with <em>Beijing</em>; <em>Shenzhen</em>; and <em>Guangzhou</em>, they are the biggest metropolitan city in China.

      <h2>Toronto</h2>
      <p>Toronto is the capital of the province of Ontario. It is the most populous city in Canada, and the fourth populous city in North America. It is also recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world. I came to Canada in 2019 and studied in Lakefield College School. Whenever in holidays, I would go back to Toronto and live in my uncle's house. Last year during the Covid pandemic, the school closed and I wasn't able to go back home to Shanghai. My uncle was happy to let me stay over the summer and it was a pleasant experience. </p>
